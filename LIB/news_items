Act (created in 2004) hosted 34 of the 99 Perl conferences
organized since 1999!

The addition of Unicode opened the way for non-latin based translations.
In the last few months, we've seen the addition of Hebrew (Perl Workshop
in Israel), Russian (Russian Perl Workshop), Ukrainian (Ukrainian Perl
Workshop) and Belarusian (Belarusian Perl Workshop).

With YAPC::Asia, a Japanese translation is expected soon.

After so many years of procrastination,
we have finally sorted the licensing out, and decided to go with the
