<h1><a name="description">Fund for Act development</a></h1>

<p>September 21, 2014</p>

<p> Act (A Conference Toolkit) is the conference management tool
that has been used to organize more than 175 Perl conferences in the
last ten years. Rewritten in 2004, based on the software used to run
the <a href="http://conferences.mongueurs.net/ye2003/">YAPC::Europe
conference in Paris in 2003</a>, it was open sourced in 2007.
<a href="conferences.html">Since then, 6 different Act instances have been
setup around the world, hosting a grand total of 183 conferences so far.</a>
</p>

<p>
In the last few years, the software has started to show its age: very
few new features have been added, and the users and conferences organizers
have had to learn to work their way around its limitations. As it is the
<i>de facto</i> standard for organizing Perl conferences, there have been
several attempts to rejuvenate it (the YAPC NA 2012 team forked it to use PSGI,
<a href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/2013/05/2013q2-gp-yact---yet-another-c.html">Torsten
Raudssus started the YACT project under a TPF Grant</a>, etc.)
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/2014/07/grant-proposal-start-act---voy.html">The
latest attempt by Theo van Hoesel, also under a TPF Grant</a>, has managed
to round up a lot of goodwill around it, including that of some of the
original authors.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.mongueurs.net/">The French Perl Mongers</a>, who
authored <a href="https://github.com/book/Act">Act</a> and are running
the biggest Act instance (155 conferences so far), would very much like
to push Act in the modern age. In support for the current effort led by
Theo van Hoesel (and other future efforts) to improve Act, the French
Perl Mongers are setting up an "Act fund" to cover the expenses of Act
hackers participating to the improvement of Act.
</p>
<p>
This fund is not meant to pay salaries, or offer grants, but to cover
travel and accommodation of hackers involved in the current and future
efforts to improve Act. The Act fund will be fully disclosed to the
public, on the Act website, with all income and expenses listed.
(See <a href="#fund">below</a>.)
</p>
<p>
The goal of the fund is to help the people working to improve Act, so
that the Perl community can finally <i>have an improved Act</i> to use.
Some of it is by getting the keepers of the main database (the French Perl
Mongers) more involved with what's happening. Another big part of it
is to facilitate communication between the people the more involved in
the project. Hackathons have proved their worth, mostly because of the
value of face-to-face communication.
</p>
<p>
The two Act-related events following the creation of the fund are the
upcoming hackathons in <a href="http://patch.pm/p2/">Lyon</a> and <a
href="http://osdc.no">Oslo</a>, which both will be, in part or full,
focused on Act improvements.
