=head1 UNPRIORITIZED TODO LIST

=over 4

=item *

let the organizers force the registration of existing users
(useful for speakers who can't be bothered to use the site,
but will give a talk)

=item *

the payments page should let the one create a new user, register it
and add a payment (and use the code for finding duplicate users)
(useful for on site registration during the conference)

=item *

convert the whole application to UTF8

=item *

replace Act::Form by Data::FormValidator

=item *

list and document all the templates in the application

=item *

divide the template content between structural information needed
by the application (e.g. creation of the schedule, application
forms) and presentation information which should be overridable by
conference-specific templates

=item *

define a set of coherent CSS styles for the application templates,
so that conference organizers may easily override the application
look and feel, and integrate it into their web site

=item *

define a procedure (and possibly write some helper scripts) to
manage the text modifications. When someone changes some text
in the templates, the may be able to translate it at best in
one or two other languages. Other translators need to be
informed of the changes.

=item *

track management: organizers should be able to create tracks for
their conference, speakers should be able to select a track for their talk

=item *

talk languages: define a set of accepted languages for a conference
and let the speakers set the talk language

=item *

talk target audience: beginner, intermediate, advanced.

=item *

provide a full canonical url in each conf/act.ini for inter-conference links

=item *

move the existing conf/act.ini out of Act.

=item *

attendees: if a registered user doesn't show up, how is s/he counted?
should there be a way for the organisers to mark the attendees as
present?

=item *

password modification page

=item *

a website for managing one's profile outside any conference

=item *

some statistics for the organizers
- T-shirts stats:
  select count(*), tshirt_size from participations where conf_id=? group by tshirt_size;
- family stats:
  select sum(nb_family) from participations where conf_id=?

=item *

remove duplicate users from the database. this is an administrative task 
which requires contacting users and asking which of their many logins
to keep

=item *

problem with empty fields: they are not updated
see: stay pseudonymous, remove company

=item *

there are 4 kinds or roles within a conference:
- user management
- talks management
- payments management
- rights management
this implies a modification of the existing rights:
- the name "orga" doesn't mean anything
- "staff" has no clear domain
- nowhere in the code should there be an "or" checking of rights
  (like is_staff || is_orga): if some user needs to see such and
  such parts of the site, they need the appropriate right

=item *

integrate a wiki into Act (using the Act users logins, maybe restricted
to users registered to the conference)
=> this is being developped in the dev branch.

=item *

http://conferences.yapceurope.org/2005/user/214
The GPG key is often a very long string.
=> we should just store a key id, keys can be fetched from GPG key servers.

=item *

most tables should be sortable by clicking on column headers.
=> by default, sort the user search results by registration date, not
   by user_id

=item *

when a conference is over, treasurer/orga should be able to unregister
participants who didn't show up.

=item *

rights management
+ show rights in table format, users as lines, rights as columns,
  with checkboxes to grant rights, and a listbox to add a new user.
  - pro: everything is controlled through a single form (granting
    and removing rights), better per user vision.
  - against: the list of rights must be supplied
    (at worse: select distinct right_id from rights should do it)

=item *

photo gallery? Links with Flickr? tags? links with talks? author?

=item *

image resizing

=item *

usefulness of global rights?

=item *

more tests, especially for the web interface

=item *

may a user have a different photograph every year?

=item *

change the "orga" right name

=item *

think about the user prefered language as a preference list:
- ye2005,  pt => list = pt
- fpw2005, fr => list = fr,pt
- ipw2005, en => list = en,fr,pt
at that point, we need to reconfigure the prefered language for
the two other sites
Another option is to add a lang field in participations, to have
a favorite language per conference

=item *

global user stats (top attendee, top speaker, etc)

=item *

user-configurable searchlimit

=item *

support for several monger groups (addition, search)

=item *

get the production conf/ out of Act

=item *

PDF immutable invoices

=item *

replace Act::Object with a more trendy ORM

=item *

create a eg/ directory with at least two example conferences

=item *

support for per conference options, like
- register the hotel (e.g. european hackathon 2007)
- vegeratian food

=item *

hackathons do not have talks. Support that by disabling the talks
related handlers.

=item *

add a list of the top ten countries of already registered users for
the conference at the top of the country list when creating a new
user on a conference

=item *

two-steps new user creation using a confirmation email
and possibly a special validation URL

=item *

allow a conference to put a limit on the number of "paying" attendees
=> it may actually need to be a limit to "committed" attendes, since
   speakers often have the entrance fee waived

=item *

handle the edition of lightning talk sessions, by creating something
less burdensome than the current talk:id 

=item *

have the wiki support talk:id links and user:id links (or something
similar)

=item *

organizers can create new users, but there is no handler to manually
register/unregister an existing user
