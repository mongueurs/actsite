<h2>History</h2>
<p>
In 2003, when the French Perl Mong(u)e(u)rs began organising
their YAPC::Europe in Paris, they thought about the web site
and what they wanted to do with it. Starting from Sylvain Lhullier's
prototype, Éric Cholet and Philippe Bruhat created a conference web site
that was multilingual, template-driven, and able to manage the users, talks,
schedule and payment.
</p><p>
The year after, when preparing the first French Perl Workshop, Éric and
Philippe worked on a second system, designed from the beginning to support
everything the old site could do, with one difference: it had to support
multiple conferences. Act (A Conference Toolkit) was born. They wanted
to support several French Workshops without having to recode a conference
web site engine every year. Laziness is a lot of work... <tt>:-)</tt>
</p><p>
The <a href="http://www.yapceurope.org/">YAPC Europe Foundation</a>
was created just after YAPC Europe in Paris, to help and support the
organisation of Perl conferences in Europe. Since YEF and Act are hosted
on the French mongers system, it was only natural that Act became a part
of the service provided by YEF.
</p><p>
As of September 8, 2008, Act supports 16 languages:
Belarusian, Chinese, Croatian, Dutch, English, French, German, Hebrew, Hungarian,
Italian, Japanese, Norwegian, Portuguese, Russian and Slovak.
</p>

<h2>Is Act the official Perl conference software?</h2>

<p>
Certainly not, but
<a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/">The Perl Foundation</a> has
shown significant interest in Act:

</ul>

<p>
However, becoming the official Perl conference software is on the
roadmap of our world domination plan! <tt>;-)</tt>

<h2>Name</h2>
<p>
The name of the toolkit is <u>Act</u>, not ACT.
</p><p>
Even if it looks like an acronym (inspired by the one of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_%28programming_language%29">APL</a>),
it is more of an inspirational injunction to conference organizers to forget
about hacking the website and organize their conference. In short: "Act!".
</p>

<h2>History of Act language support</h2>
<p>
Act started as a bilingual tool (French and English), but over time, many
new languages have been added:
